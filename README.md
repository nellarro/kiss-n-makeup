This is my capstone project from The Iron Yard. 

Twelve weeks before October 7th, 2016, I had no idea what a <div> was let alone how to use it. Kiss & Makeup started off as a project with a blank root page and now it's a functioning web application. 

Kiss & Makeup will be continuously updated because I believe that users should be able to catalouge to their hearts desire. 

As I learn new technologies, other frameworks, and meet more developers and users with great ideas, this app shall be updated.

Thanks for reading!
